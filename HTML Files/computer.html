    <section>
        <p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that
            processes data to perform various tasks according to
            instructions given to it. It consists of hardware
            components, such as the central processing unit (CPU),
            memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), input
            devices (keyboard, mouse), and output devices (monitor,
            printer), as well as software programs that control its
            operations</p>

        <h2>Function of a computer</h2>

        <p>omputers can execute a wide range of functions, from
            simple calculations and data processing to complex
            operations like running software applications, browsing the
            internet, playing multimedia content, and controlling
            external devices. They operate based on binary code, using
            combinations of zeros and ones to represent data and
            instructions.</p>

        <h2>Forms of a computer</h2>

        <p>omputers come in various forms, including desktop computers,
            laptops, tablets, smartphones, servers, and embedded systems.
            They are used in virtually every industry and aspect of modern
            life, from business and education to entertainment, healthcare,
            and scientific research. The versatility and capabilities of
            computers continue to evolve rapidly, driving innovation and
            shaping the way we live, work, and communicate in the digital
            age</p>

        <h2>Hardware components</h2>
        <p>Hardware components are physical
            parts of a computer system that you
            can touch and see. These components
            work together to perform various tasks
            and operations</p>


        <h2>Types Of Hardware</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">(CPU):</abbr> The CPU is
                often
                referred to as the brain of the computer. It performs
                calculations and executes instructions to carry out
                tasks. The speed and performance of the CPU affect
                how quickly a computer can process data.</li>



            <li>Memory <abbr title=" Random Access
                Memory">(RAM):</abbr> RAM, or, is a type of temporary storage
                that the CPU uses to store data and
                instructions while the computer is
                running. It allows for fast access to
                frequently used data, which helps
                improve overall system performance</li>

            <li>Storage Devices: Storage devices are
                used to store data permanently.
                Examples include hard disk drives
                (HDDs), which use spinning magnetic
                disks to store data, and solid-state drives
                (SSDs), which use flash memory chips for
                faster data access.</li>
        </ul>
