        <h2>What really is web development
        </h2>

        <p><b>Web development</b> is the <b> process of building and maintaining websites or web
                applications</b> that you see and interact with on the internet. It involves <strong>writing
                code,</strong> <strong>designing layouts,</strong>
            and <strong>organizing information</strong> to create <strong> functional</strong> and <strong>visually
                appealing</strong>
            online experiences. In simpler terms, it's like constructing and decorating a <strong>digital space</strong>
            where people can visit, explore, and do things like shop, read, or connect with others</p>

        <h2>Who are web developer and what do they do?</h2>
        <p>Web developers are the <b>architects and builders of the internet (World Wide Web)</b>. They are
            skilled professionals who create websites and web applications that you see and use every day.
        </p>

        <p>In simple terms, <strong>they write code to bring web designs to life, making sure everything works
                smoothly and looks good on your screen</strong>. They might work on the visible parts that you interact
            with (front-end development) or the behind-the-scenes logic and databases (back-end
            development), or even both (full-stack development). Essentially, we are the ones who make the
            web work!</p>

                website or web application that users directly interact with in their web browsers. It
                involves using languages like <strong>>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to build the user interface
                and
