    <!-- The Internet: What really is the internet -->
    <section>
        <h2>what really is the internet?</h2>
        <p>n simple terms, the internet is a global network of computers and other devices that are connected
            together, allowing them to communicate and share information with each other. It's like a giant web of
            interconnected devices that spans the entire world.
            Imagine the internet as a massive network of roads connecting different cities and towns. Each device
            connected to the internet, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and servers, is like a house or
            building along these roads.
            When you use the internet, you're essentially sending and receiving data (like messages, pictures, videos,
            and web pages) between your device and other devices around the world. This data travels through the
            network of connections, passing through various routers, switches, and servers until it reaches its
            destination.</p>

            <li>
                Internet Service Provider <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">(ISP) or Mobile Network
                    Provicder</abbr>

                <p>
                    It typically involves an ISP (Internet Service Provider) in the case of a wired connections, such as
                    DSL,
                    cable, fiber optic, or satellite. They deliver internet connectivity to homes, businesses, and other
                    locations
                    using infrastructure like phone lines, coaxial cables, fiber optic cables, or wireless technologies.
                    Example
                    is Spectranet, ipNX, Starlink e.t.c
                    Mobile Network Providers also known as mobile carriers or wireless carriers, offer wireless cellular
                    network services for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and mobile hotspots. In addition,
                    they
                    offer voice calling, texting (SMS), and multimedia messaging (MMS) services. They operate cellular
                    networks that allow devices to connect to the internet wirelessly using technologies like GSM, CDMA,
                    LTE, and 5G. Examples include MTN, Airtel, Glo, Etisalat

            <li>Hardware</li>
            <p>You need the right hardware to connect to the internet</p>

            <p>This usually includes a modem and a router in the case of connecting to an ISP</p>

            <p>But for a mobile phone you simply need your SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) provided by your
                mobile network operator. The SIM card contains unique information that identifies you as a subscriber to
                the network and allows your device to communicate with it.</p>
